spdylay 1.1.0
=============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes several bugs in shrpx and spdycat. It is strongly
recommended for the users who use shrpx and spdycat to upgrade to this
version.  Historically, spdylay.h header defined
SPDYLAY_INITIAL_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS macro as 100 and all internal
code and utility programs (spdycat and spdyd) use that. However, this
limit is not specified in the SPDY specification and may trigger
unexpected stream closure to the other SPDY
implementations. Therefore, it is now defined the large enough value.

Changes
-------

* shrpx: Enable --honor-cipher-order automatically when --ciphers is used

* spdycat: allocate sufficient memory, patch from soyer.

* shrpx: Add DHE cipher suite support

  Use --dh-param-file option to specify a file including DH parameters
  in PEM format.

* shrpx: Add ECDH cipher support

* shrpx: Close upstream connection if CONNECT failed in downstream

* shrpx: Replace \r\n in the header field to SPC in http downstream

* shrpx: Require content-length in SPDY upstream if FIN flag is not set

* Return error if spdylay_gzip_inflate is invoked after Z_STREAM_END

* shrpx: Limit read rate on upstream-end

* shrpx: Make "dconn_ is NULL" message INFO level

* shrpx: Save pid file after daemon() call

* shrpx: Accept incoming bytes at least initial window size (65536 bytes)

* shrpx: Fix possible multiple replies on SPDY upstream

* shrpx: Return -1 if dconn_ is nullptr on push_upload_data_chunk

* Change SPDYLAY_INITIAL_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS

  The previous value 100 is non-standard, and if it is not sent with
  SETTINGS, session will be closed with protocol error.

* src: Send out data in output buffer before SPDY session tear down

* shrpx: Fix bug: end marker of chunked encoding is written twice
