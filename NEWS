spdylay 1.2.0
=============

Release Note
------------

This release adds SPDY/3.1 support and fixes flow control bug.  The
shrpx, SPDY proxy, got client certificate authentication.  It now also
supports custom HTTP-version string (e.g., ICY).  The spdycat and
spdyd got --color option to force ANSI color escape in output.

Changes
-------

* shrpx: Add options to specify per-connection window size

* Interleave streams with same priority

* Add SPDY/3.1 support

  The added feature is connection-level flow control.

* src/http-parser: Allow custom HTTP-version string (e.g., ICY)

  We need HTTP major and minor version later, so we assume it is
  HTTP/1.0 equivalent if custom HTTP-version string is used.

* src/http-parser: Update to HEAD

* shrpx: Add --verify-client-cacert option

  Using --cacert to load certificate for client certificate
  authentication is problematic since, --cacert is also used for
  client mode.  This commit adds --verify-client-cacert option which
  specify the CA certficate file used only for client certificate
  validation.  This change also removes the default certficate load
  function for client certificate validation.

* shrpx: Add --verify-client option

  This option requires client certificate and successful verification.
  Use --cacert option to add CA certificates as necessary.

* spdycat, spdyd: Add --color option to force colored log output

* shrpx: Check DATA_FLAG_FIN on on_data_recv_callback

* tests: Fix main test fail with address-sanitizer

* Fix outbound flow control count

  We wrongly added the whole payload length even if we sent part of it.

* shrpx: Fix missing extension HTTP status code in response

* shrpx: Add rate limit options

* shrpx: Replace \r\n with space when constructing HTTP/1 headers

* shrpx: Guard ecdh use with !OPENSSL_NO_EC

* spdylay_ssl: fix the user-agent position

  Patch from soyer

* spdycat: Add missing verbose output for upload DATA

* Call on_stream_close_callback for stream in SPDYLAY_STREAM_INITIAL state

  We call on_stream_close_callback even if stream->state is
  SPDYLAY_STREAM_INITIAL. This will happen while sending request
  HEADERS, a local endpoint receives RST_STREAM for that stream. It
  may be PROTOCOL_ERROR, but without notifying stream closure will
  hang the stream in a local endpoint.
